This program is very simple and only accepts 6 letters.

The purpose of this program is to play the imessage gamepigeon game anagrams and have my program find the words you can make from those letters.

I don't have every word in the dictionary, but I have ove 10,000 words in the library total.

If you aren't playing the game, you can enter 6 random letters and watch my program generate many words that can be made out of those letters.

Enjoy!
